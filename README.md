# Sales Data Analysis with Python 📊

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates a basic **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline. It was developed to practice data manipulation skills.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Loading:** Reading and handling CSV files using Pandas.
- **Data Transformation:** Grouping and aggregating data to find business insights.
- **Data Export:** Generating automated reports in CSV format.
- **Paradigm:** Clean and documented Procedural Programming in Python.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas

The script processes raw sales records and generates a category_report.csv, which summarizes total revenue by product category, helping in business decision-making.
